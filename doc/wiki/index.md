# Markdoc Documentation

Markdoc is a lightweight Markdown-based wiki system. It’s been designed to allow you to create and manage wikis as quickly as possible, and with a minimum of difficulty. This documentation is completely Markdoc-powered.

You should start by looking at the [quickstart](/quickstart) document. That should give you all the information you need to put together a simple Markdoc wiki. You can learn about how to format your documents on the [markup](/markup) page.

See the [configuration](/configuration) documentation for in-depth knowledge about how to write a good `markdoc.yaml` file. The [layout](/layout) documentation will tell you about the basic wiki filesystem layout. After that, the [tips](/tips/) directory is a good source of recipes to make Markdoc useful to you.

The Markdoc project’s goals and history are described in the [about](/about) page. If you’d like to know more about how Markdoc works at a deeper level, see the [internals directory](/internals/).

To see the complete list of pages in this wiki, you can browse the [directory listing](/_list).
